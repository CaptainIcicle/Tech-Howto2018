Linux Basics:
What is linux?
- Open Source OS utilized for many opensource projects
Should I use linux?
If you want a gaming PC (NO)
If you want to do other things and improve productivity
I highly reccomend using linux

Basic Commands:
pwd - Prints working directory
ls - lists everything in a directory
cd [Directory] - Changes what directory you wish to go into
apt-get install [module] - installs any module available
to the system
./[example] - This will execute any file that can be excuted in terminal
chmod - Gives/Removes a file's permission to execute

adding -h at the end of any command will display a help menu for that module
most times. 

Can I execute files like on Windows10 or MacOS?
No, unfortunately most things are done through a command line
while there are many applications for linux that are click to execute
many of the things you will encounter on linux is command line
scripts and applications.
